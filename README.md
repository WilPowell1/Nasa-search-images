A React application which allows users to search for images courtesy of the NASA images API. The user inputs a key word related to the cosmos e.g "the sun", "Jupiter", "asteroids" etc. in to the search field which then retrieve imaged from the API. Only valid queries will successfully retrieve images.

This project is based on learning materials created by Manchester Codes and was bootstrapped with Create React App.

You can visit the deployed app at https://nasa-search-images.vercel.app/.
